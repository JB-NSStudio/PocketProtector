# PocketProtector
Prevent your pocket from accidentally using your phone.

## What does the tweak do?
- Detects when the iPhone's proximity sensor is activated as near.
- After the prox. sensor has been activated, start tracking motion.
- If the device is upside down (to a configurable amount), dimm and lock the screen after a configuable amount of time.
<br/><br/>
## Open Source
- This was a quick project I put together for a school project, so why not OS it. I also am a firm beleiver in OS contributing to learning developers
as this was vital in my journey and still is. My challenge to any aspiring or novice tweak devs is to add an option to turn off screen dimming, some people might not want it. If you do it, make a PR and I'll push the update!
- I plan to go through and comment what everything does, most of it is pretty self explanatory, but the "enqueue" methods description can be found in [PowerUp](https://github.com/JB-NSStudio/PowerUp)

## DragonBuild
  This was the first tweak I have built using the dragon toolkit. It is significantly faster than the typical theos enviroment
  but has some bugs as its still being worked on. I loved using dragon throughly, but probably wouldnt recommend it to beginning devs
  as there arent as many troubleshooting resources. I have provided a fully working makefile and DragonMake file should you chose to try to build with either
